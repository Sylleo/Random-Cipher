# Random-Cipher

### 10/30/2016
This is a random password generator written in Python. You can use it to generate your random password, which includes 13 commonly used symbols, 26 English letters, as well as the numbers 0 ~ 9. But it is only implemented through a simple random number generator (I do it just for practice), so it may have a certain risk, and you are on your own risk.
